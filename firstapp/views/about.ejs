            About Me
            <br>
            Hi, my name is Jamaine Genius and I am junior at Brandeis University majoring in Computer Science and History. 
            <br>
            I am from New Jersey and I like working on different computer science projects, learning about new technologies, and playing video games,
            <br>
            playing video games, listening to music, and playing sports. 
            <br>
            The games in the images are some my favorite games which are created by Team Asano because they highlight how 2D games can still be visually spectacular.
            <br>
            Team Asano managed to create stunning 2D visuals in Unreal Engine in a 3D world to create a very unique art style.
            <br>
            This is important to me becuase it highlights how modern technologies can bring life into older forms of artistry and techniques.
            <br>
            For this assignment I decided to create a webapp that integrates with openai's GPT-3 API.
            <br>
            My personal changes to the app are a simple rock paper scissors game against GPT-3 and also a list of fake pokemon to help myself and rom hackers to design new Fake Pok√©mon or more popularly known as Fakemons .
